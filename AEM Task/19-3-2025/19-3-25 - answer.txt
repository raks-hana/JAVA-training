1.What is DAM and why we use it?
ans:
DAM (Digital Asset Management) in AEM is used for managing digital assets like images, videos, and documents efficiently.

Centralized storage for assets
Version control for images and videos
Renditions (auto-generated different sizes of images)
Metadata tagging for better searchability

2.Create one folder inside our project folder and follow the path: 
“/content/dam/myTraining/us/en-us” and upload 2 images and author those images on page using image component as we see today.


3.What is renditions? Check the renditions for 2 images which we had uploaded
ans:
Renditions are different versions (or thumbnails) of an image automatically generated by AEM when you upload an image to DAM (Digital Asset Manager).
Helps in optimizing images for different devices (desktop, mobile, tablet).
Improves page performance by serving smaller versions instead of the full image.
AEM automatically generates renditions when you upload an image
